                          <br/><br/> Standardized Returns assume reinvestment of dividends and capital gains. It depicts performance without adjusting for the effects of taxation. For variable annuities, additional expenses are not reflected in this analysis, including M&E risk charges, fund-level expenses such as management fees and operating fees, and contract-level administration fees, charges such as surrender, contract and sales charges.
                          
                          <br/><br/>The Recommended Portfolio was selected based on answers provided on the Investor Profile Questionnaire used in conjunction with the Investment Planning Center. The Recommended Portfolio uses investments we recommend for each asset class. Investments not considered in this presentation may have similar or superior characteristics to those being recommended and analyzed. This analysis does not consider any negative consequences that may result from redeeming your Current Portfolio to invest in the Recommended Portfolio. These consequences may include, but are not limited to, redemption fees and charges, and tax consequences. Please carefully consider these consequences before making changes to your Current Portfolio. Performance results do not reflect advisory fees. Inclusion of advisory fees would result in lower stated performance. 
                          Diversification neither assures a profit nor guarantees against loss in a declining market. 
                          The risks associated with investing in stocks and overweighting small company and value stocks potentially include increased volatility (up and down movement in the value of your assets) and loss of principal. 
                          Small company stocks may be subject to a higher degree of market risk than the securities of more established companies because they may be more volatile and less liquid. 
                          Securities of small companies are often less liquid than those of large companies. As a result, small company stocks may fluctuate relatively more in price. 
                          International markets involve additional risks, including, but not limited to, currency fluctuation, political instability, foreign taxes, and different methods of accounting and financial reporting. As a result, they may not be suitable investment options for everyone. 
                          Changes in currency exchange rates, differences in accounting and taxation policies and political and economical instability can raise or lower returns.
