          Consider the investment objectives, risks, charges, and expenses of the SA 
          Funds carefully before investing. The prospectus contains this and other 
          information about SA Funds. To obtain a prospectus, additional infor-

          <p>The simulated performance based on index data shown is 'gross- perfor-
          mance,' which includes the reinvestment of dividends and other earnings
          but does not reflect the deduction of investment advisory and administractive 
          fees. A client's investment returns will be reduced by advisory account. for example, if 
          a 1% annual advisory fee were deducted quarterly and a client's annual return
          were 10% (based on quarterly returns of approximately 2.41% each) before 
          deduction of advisory fees, the deduction of advisory fees would result in an 
          annual return approximately 8.91% due, in part, to the compound effect of
          such fees. Advisory fees are described in Part II of your advisor's and Loring
          Ward's Forms ADV which may be obtained, without cost, from you advisor. A 
          financial advisor may not provide an investor with 'gross performance' infor-
          mation unless the advisor does so in a one-on-one presentation.</p>
